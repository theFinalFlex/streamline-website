                        <p>Our standard fee outlined in the fee agreement is 1% of the gross loan amount. The fee is considered earned after the loan funds, not before. That means we do not charge an upfront fee of any kind. Our goal is aligned with your goal to ensure we are both working together in good faith striving for the same outcome!</p>

                        <p>We’ll connect to learn more about your financing needs. With the information we have, we’ll advise you of your options. We’ll devise a strategy to proceed with our plan. We’ll present your file to multiple banks. We’ll leverage our network to gain multiple offers. We’ll strategically negotiate to achieve the best possible financial solution for you.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The time it takes between submitting a full loan package to the funding of the loan is typically 45 – 60 days. This largely depends on how quickly you, the loan applicant, responds to questions and requests for documents, signatures, etc. There are also other factors including the lender's deal flow, stimulus packages, staffing, etc.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We review the file to look for challenges to seeking capital. We present the loan to the bank to make their lives as easy as possible by eliminating issues before they come up in underwriting. The end result is that you have more offers in less time.</p>
                        <p>If you only work with one bank, you might run into the issue of the bank turning down the loan, meaning you’ll have to start the entire process over with another bank. Gaining multiple offers at once reduces this occurrence.</p>
                        <p>If there is a challenge that eliminates traditional financing or time is of the essence, we have in-house private capital that can provide the needed solution. We will create a bridge loan to help close the deal and keep your business moving forward.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Utilizing Streamline will connect your business with financing experts who go to work for you providing multiple options. When you go with one bank, you typically only get one or no offer. You lose the power of negotiation and the option to choose which offer is best suited for your business. When you are not approved, you must start the process all over again with a new bank. Working with Streamline will put you in a stronger position to seek the best financing solution for your business.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We know how the banks underwrite their loans based on our experience. Having experts preparing your file and presenting the loan in the best light reduces the chance of future challenges delaying the funding of the loan.</p>
                        <p>When the problem is such that no bank will provide financing, we have in-house private capital to provide our clients with the solutions they are seeking.</p>

                        <p>Yes, in fact, we are with you throughout the entire process. This means we are communicating with the lender and you to make sure everyone is on the same page until the loan funds.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Yes, this happens sometimes. Don’t worry, we work with you to ensure that more options are always ready to proceed so that if the chosen lender isn’t able to perform, there is another lender ready to pick up and run with your loan application. Always being prepared for unexpected challenges is one of the advantages of working with Streamline.</p>
